RestrictTabView
================

ProcessWire module for restricting access to view various Page Edit tabs via permissions

##CONFIG SETTINGS

There are two sections: View Tabs, and Hide Tabs and you can use a combination of both.

If a tab has been checked, access to view/hide that tab is controlled by permissions named in the following format:
tab-tabname-view, eg: tab-settings-view OR tab-tabname-hide, eg: tab-settings-hide

It is your responsibility to create these permissions as required and assign them to the roles you want to restrict view access to.
